# Boids
A simulation of carnivorous animal in an environment, written in Processing

#Instructions
To run the code you will need Processing ([found here](http://processing.org))

#Debugging
**D**, **F** and **G** will show different debugging information.
--------
<br />**D** shows framerate, current generation and the amount of boids in the envrionment.
<br />**F** shows lines between boids which are interacting with each other, the blue half of the line shows the prodator, the green half is the prey.
<br />**G** shows information about each boid as red text. It shows agression, fullness, max speed etc...

#Seeded random
Pressing the number keys will seed the randomness so that the boids will react in the same way each time.
<br />**NOTE**: Will restart the simulation

#Saving
You can save a simulation by pressing P and load it by pressing O
<br />**NOTE**: Saving will overwite any previous save file.
<br />**RENAME ANY SAVE FILES YOU WANT TO KEEP**
