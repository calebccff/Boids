#Boids
A simulation of carnivorous animals in an environment, written in Processing.
This branch is a remake using genetic algorothms for breeding which will allow for a much more realistic simulation (chapter 9 of The Nature of Code)
btw Owen I'm on holiday so no wifi, at a pub so I'll upload when I get home

#Instructions
To run the code you will need [Processing](http://processing.org).

#Debugging
**D**, **F** and **G** will show different debug information.
--------
<br />**D** shows the framerate, the current generation, the amount of boids and averages of various statistics.
<br />**F** shows lines between boids which are interacting with each other, the blue half of the line shows the predator, the green half is the prey.
<br />**G** shows various statistics (agression, fullness, max speed, etc) about each boid as red text.

#Seeded random
Pressing the number keys will seed the randomness so that the boids will react in the same way each time.
<br />**NOTE**: Will restart the simulation.

#Saving
You can save a simulation by pressing P and load it by pressing O.
<br />**NOTE**: Saving will overwite any previous 'save.txt' file.
<br />**RENAME ANY SAVE FILES YOU WANT TO KEEP.**
